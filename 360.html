      <h2>What Is 360° Photography?</h2>
      <p>
        Photography has many different forms, some people use film, some people
        use digital and some people even use a demon in a box that draws the
        pictures for you... however, this isn't Discworld and the imaging
        techniques used aren't going to be that simple...or magical. 360°
        photography is an imaging technique that has been applied in many
        different medias and situations as its uses can present a large amount
        of detail in a single area. Its ability to put a viewer in the centre of
        a scene means one can pan up down, left, and right, Giving the viewers
        the experience of being within the image looking around. These 360°
        images are a type of panorama (images stitched together in a line) which
        have had many ways of being captured and presented since its first use.
        Varying successes and weaknesses have been noted as technology in this
        area of photography has evolved.
      </p>

      <h3>A Brief History Of 360° Photography?</h3>
      <p>
        There is not much information about the introduction of 360° imaging as
        its use has only started to take off over the last two decades. There
        have been quite a few ways of producing spherical panoramas starting
        from the 1990's release of the Noblex Panoramic cameras, which had a
        lens that panned 136° to capture a long panorama on one piece of film.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another 360° imaging technique called the Kaidan 360 VR One, a lens
        developed between companies Kaidan and Eyesee360 and offers a 'complete
        360° image in a single snapshot', however this single shot is presented
        in the form of a 'doughnut' due to the lens optics but with computer
        effects can be made to look like a spherical image.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the complexities of these panoramic methods the Noblex and Kaidan
        are not cheap, costing between £750 and £1000 brand new however both the
        Noblex and Kaidan are no longer manufactured.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the 2010's other companies such as LG, Samsung, Insta360 and
        Ricoh have all released their submission for portable consumer all in
        one 360 cameras where all of the image capture and post process in done
        in camera, costing from £150 for the LG360 Cam up to £300 for the Ricoh
        Theta and even £400 for the Insta360 One X. Like most technology 360°
        imaging cameras rise up in quality as you pay more money, with the
        Insta360 One X offering up a 18 megapixel image with a resolution of
        6080 x 3040 whereas the cheaper LG 360 Cam only offering up 13 megapixel
        images with image resolutions of 5,660 x 2,830, with technology so
        rapidly evolving, it is safe to say that today's new and latest ideas,
        will be tomorrows history.

        To conclude the results provide evidence that the method that provides
        the best quality while not sacrificing too much valuable time is the
        18mm lens which contradicts most studies on 360° imaging which suggest
        that the best panoramic method was to have fewer images because it means
        less stiches such as the 10.5mm lens method whereas the images and
        comparisons produced during this study suggest that spending an extra 10
        to 15 minutes on a slightly larger focal length can dramatically improve
        the image quality in a panorama and reduce distortion which aids
        stitching. Lens No. of Photos

        The image below shows a comparison of four panoramas, all taken at the
        same position in the same scene, presented in Adobe Photoshop all zoomed
        into 100% all focusing on the same object and straight away it is clear
        that there is a dramatic difference in quality between the first (LG 360
        Cam) and final image (50mm lens). The aim for this study was to find the
        best method of taking and producing 360° images for briefing and
        evidential purposes for police. the LG 360 Cam would make as a good
        images for speed and a really brief look around of a scene but would not
        be much use for anything else due to its low quality whereas the
        panorama produced by the 50mm lens is extremely high quality and would
        be a good panorama to zoom into due to the amount of quality that is
        present while zooming, this would be good for showing location of
        evidence without having to add more shots making the image more complex;
        however, the 50mm images took a long time to take and stitch. This
        leaves the 10.5mm and 18mm.

        The 2 images below shows a comparison of the panoramic images produced
        by the 10.5mm and 18mm lens. The 10.5 image shows visible distortion
        along the edges of the card whereas the same section in the 18mm image
        looks more realistic due to less distortion in the image due to the
        lens. The table above shows that the panorama produced by the 18mm lens
        requires 47 more images than the 10.5mm lens which in turn nearly
        doubles the resolution of the image allowing for a much higher quality
        image when viewing, this quality boost is the result of around 10 to 15
        minutes extra of photographing at a scene. It can be concluded therefore
        that an extra 15 minutes of time spent in photographing can produce a
        much higher quality final 360° panorama which could be considered as a
        good enough compromise between quality and practicality.
